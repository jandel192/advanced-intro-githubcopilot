Now complete this exercise, you will [work directly with a model trained on real-world, biased data](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/15622654).


### Reflections
Theres a lot more type of biases you have to look out for when using AI since you want information thats just purely facts, Also coding it in a way that it can notice not so friendly terms and could prevent it from going through is neat.
