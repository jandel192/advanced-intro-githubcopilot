Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models.

For me it was model B,it felt like a nice balance between to the three.

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
The category  that was the most similar is creativity each felt that it could of been writen by  the same person.Bias is the most diffenct since it could of gotten its information from different sources ,since they all read very differently.

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
No when using AI theres never one way it presents  information.
