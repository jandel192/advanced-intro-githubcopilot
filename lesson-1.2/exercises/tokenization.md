## Tokenization
To get an intuition for how tokenization works, use the [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to see how tokens look. Try out a few prompts - and see how that gets converted into tokens, paying attention to how whitespace characters and punctuation marks are handled. 

### Prompt 1
generate an image of a dog.

### Prompt 2
how much wood does it take to make a chair.
